# gdbserver

A GDB stub for Fuchsia that supports the
[GDB Remote Serial Protocol](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Overview.html).

Refer to [this page](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/index.html) for
further documentation on debugging with GDB.

## Setting up the environment

The stub currently communicates with GDB over a TCP connection using BSD sockets
and thus requires a working Fuchsia network stack and a network connection
between the target and host environments. Follow the general network set up
instructions (click
[here](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/magenta/+/master/docs/qemu.md#Enabling-Networking-under-Qemu-x86_64-only)
for enabling network under QEMU)

**N.B.** If using QEMU make sure you are using version 2.5.0 or later.

See [this document](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/netstack/+/master/README.md) for setting up `netstack`.

## Debugging a program

### On the target machine running Fuchsia

First, make sure that the TCP stack is running and has acquired an IP address:

```
> netstack &
> ethernetif_init: opened an ethernet device
ip4_addr: 192.168.3.53 netmask: 255.255.255.0 gw: 192.168.3.1
ip6_addr[0]: FE80::5054::FF:FE12:3456
```

`192.168.3.53` is the address that we will use to connect from the host gdb
later.

**N.B.** This step is only necessary if qemu is started with netsvc disabled.
Look for the log messages below in the system boot logs.

Next, run the stub with your port number of choice (e.g. 7000) and a path to a
binary (the stub currently supports debugging a single inferior during its life
time, which needs to be passed in its command-line. Attaching to an already
running process is currently not supported):

```
debugserver 7000 /path/to/program
```

The stub has a `--debug=<debug-level>` option that can be used to increase log
verbosity. Currently only levels 1 and 2 are supported (but any positive integer
is currently accepted):

```
debugserver --debug=2 7000 /path/to/program
```

### On the host machine

Run gdb and configure it with certain parameters. The stub currently only
supports the non-stop execution mode and we need to configure gdb for it to work
correctly. We then use the `target extended-remote` command to connect to the IP
and port number that stub acquired earlier:

```
$ gdb
GNU gdb (GDB) <version>
...
(gdb) set pagination off
(gdb) set non-stop on
(gdb) set target-async on
(gdb) set architecture i386:x86-64
The target architecture is assumed to be i386:x86-64
(gdb) target extended-remote 192.168.3.53:7000
Remote debugging using 192.168.3.53:7000
```
From here we can use gdb as usual:

```
(gdb) # set some breakpoints
(gdb) run
Starting program:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00000000010f0069 in ?? ()
(gdb) # do stuff
```

TODO(armansito): Add instructions for using the `file` command for loading
symbols once that works.

## TODO

The following is an incomplete and unprioritized list of tasks that remain to be
finished for basic debugging to work:

- Retransmission on "-" ack
- Memory access following vRun but before "c".
- Support vRun with arguments so that the inferior can be provided from gdb
  using `set remote exec-file`
- sw/hw breakpoints and stepping
- vCont and friends
- Support architectures other than x86-64
- vRun should create the process (and, for now, flag an error if a process
  is already running)
- user muscle memory will make them want to type "debugserver :7000 ..."
  instead of "debugserver 7000 ...", should stay consistent
- need usable copies of ld.so.1, dsos
  - the ones in out/sysroot are stubs
